Most sensing schemes rely on driving of the NV spins with pulsed radiofrequency fields to engineer the NV Hamiltonian and make it sensitive to the target spins. In this talk, I will present an alternative approach to sensing that utilises cross-relaxation between the target spins and the probe NV spin, enabling all-optical spectroscopy of nearby electronic and nuclear spins \cite{Hall2016,Wood2016,Wood2017}. I will then show how cross-relaxation can be used to transfer polarisation to the sample, with an efficiency enhanced by up to an order of magnitude over the established Hartmann-Hahn method, leading to the first observation of hyperpolarisation of external spins using a single NV probe \cite{Broadway2017}. These results suggest that cross-relaxation could be a useful for nanoscale magnetic resonance imaging.","[Hall2016] 10.1038/ncomms10211

The needle magnetometer has a better fundamental sensitivity due to much higher density and the atoms precess coherently. Based on the theoretical estimate, the needle magnetometer's sensitivity could surpass the standard quantum limit (SQL). The purpose of levitating the ferromagnetic particle is letting the particle freely precess. The Meissner effect of the superconductors is promising for levitation. The flux pinning inside the type-I superconductor (lead) prevents the micro-particle from stable levitation, when the size of the particle is comparable with size of the flux pinning fringe of lead, the micro-particle could be easily attracted by the flux pinning and fall to the surface. The type-II superconductors are usually in mixed state, however, when the type-II superconductor has a large Hc1, and the external magnetic field is below Hc1, then Meissner effect is dominant. Another requirement for observing the needle particle processing about the magnetic field instead of orienting to the magnetic field is the angular momentum of total spins is much larger than the mechanical orbital angular momentum. In this case, the external magnetic field needs to be shielded/compensated. For a 10 um length needle, the field needs to be smaller than 1 nT. Another advantage of the superconducting levitation is that the bowl-shaped superconductor also acts as superconducting magnetic shield. This research could tell the boundary between the classical physics and the quantum physics.",[1] https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.190801,,Wang,Tao,taowang@berkeley.edu,"University of California, Berkeley","6116 Columbia Ave, Richmond, CA 94804","United States",None,"Derek Kimball","Department of Physics, California State University, East Bay, Hayward, California 94542-3084, USA","Alexander Sushkov","Department of Physics, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts 02215, USA","Dmitry Budker","Department of Physics, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720-7300, USA"

It is well known that in ferromagnetic resonance of extended films, spin-wave (SW) instabilities quickly develop as the excitation power is increased \cite{1}, preventing to achieve large angle of uniform precession. The situation is quite different in nanostructures, where SW modes are highly quantized due to the geometric confinement, and expected to influence less the magnetization dynamics in the nonlinear regime. In this work, we probe the magnetization dynamics of an ultra-low damping YIG nano-disk \cite{2} using magnetic resonance force microscopy (MRFM). Ultra-large amplitude precession with complete suppression of the longitudinal component is achieved by pumping the sample with a uniform microwave field. Strikingly, we measure that the foldover shift is not constantly growing as the power is increased, but instead presents plateaus, pointing towards nonlinear energy dissipation to quantized SW modes, which is confirmed by micromagnetic simulations. In addition, by applying a second microwave field we are able to excite the SW resonances in the large-amplitude precession state. The lowest energy mode corresponds to the uniform nutation of the magnetization about its stable precession trajectory, whose frequency was shown to have a similar form as the Rabi formula, generalized to take into account nonlinearities \cite{4}. Micromagnetic simulations show that higher order modes are nutation modes with spatial gradients, i.e., SW nutation modes.","[1] 10.1016/0022-3697(57)90010-0

The conversion from the spin angular momentum to the macroscopic rotation was experimentally demonstrated in ferromagnetic bodies by Einstein and De Haas while Barnett succeeded its inverse conversion. Very recently, from the analytical solution of the Dirac equation with a general covariance, Matsuo et al. theoretically predicted that the same kind of mutual conversion can be realized for free electrons in non-magnetic metals with a weak spin orbital coupling \cite{1}. We demonstrated a conversion of alternating spin current (SC) from a macroscopic rotation generated by surface acoustic wave (SAW) which propagates in a NiFe / Cu bilayer deposited on a LiNbO$_3$ substrate \cite{2} \. An FMR excited in the NiFe layer was successfully observed when the fundamental frequency of SAW matched with the FMR frequency. The strength of FMR excitation was strongly suppressed when the Cu layer was removed from the bilayer or an insulating SiO$_2$ layer was inserted in the interface of the bilayer. This is the clear evidence that the alternating SC generated in Cu layer via spin-rotation coupling (SRC) plays an important role for the FMR excitation. The angular dependence of the strength of FMR excitation quantitatively supports the successful generation of alternating SC using SAW via SRC. Our experimental result will open the way to generate an alternating SC in variety of SAW devices without using ferromagnets and/or nonmagnetic materials with large spin-orbital coupling.","[1] https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.87.180402

In order to model the dynamics of a single-domain magnetic needle in a magnetic field, the dissipation of spin components not along the axis of easiest magnetization must be taken into account \cite{2}. Where there is dissipation, fluctuations are also present \cite{4}.  Fluctuations are a source of uncertainty that can affect the accuracy of the magnetometer.  We calculate the dynamics of a magnetic needle in the presence of an external magnetic field and determine the uncertainty of a magnetic needle magnetometer due to the fluctuations that give rise to Gilbert damping \cite{2}, i.e., interactions with internal degrees of freedom such as lattice vibrations, spin waves, and thermal electric currents.  We solve the Heisenberg equations of motion for the spin, ${\hat {\bf S}}$, the unit vector in the direction of the axis of easiest magnetization, ${\hat {\bf n}}$, and the total angular momentum,  ${\hat {\bf J}}$, in mean-field approximation \cite{5}  by taking quantum expectation values of the equations, and noting that for large spin and orbital angular momentum, the standard deviation is small compared to the quantum average.   When fluctuations are included, numerical solution of the stochastic equations is difficult when the anisotropy coefficient is large.  Therefore we develop a perturbative solution around the adiabatic solution.  Analysis of the uncertainty in such magnetic field measurements in the limit of small and large magnetic fields will be presented.","[1] 10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.190801

due to  the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) \cite{1}. The DC electric current flowing in the Pt layer creates, due to the spin-Hall effect, a perpendicular spin current which, being injected into the AFM layer, tilts the DMI-canted AFM sublattices out of the easy plane, thus exposing them to the action
of a strong internal exchange magnetic field of the AFM. The sublattice magnetizations along with the small net magnetization vector of a canted AFM start to rotate about the hard  anisotropy axis of the AFM with the THz frequency proportional to the injected spin current and a square root of the AFM exchange field. The rotation of the small net magnetization results in the THz -frequency dipolar radiation that can be directly received by an adjacent (e.g. dielectric) resonator. We demonstrate theoretically that the generated frequencies in the range $f = $0.05- 2.0 THz are possible at the experimentally reachable magnitudes of the driving current density, and evaluate the

Due to the presence of the angular momentum, the vortex beam has a characteristic spatial distribution of electromagnetic fields. Making use of the spatial features, we theoretically propose new ways of generating/controlling magnetic nanostructures such as skyrmions and skyrmioniums \cite{2} in magnets with vortex beams. We concentrate on two set ups: Applications of high- (ultraviolet, visible) and low-frequency (Tera Hz: THz) vortex beams to magnets. In the case of the high-frequency beam, its oscillation is too faster for typical spin dynamics and the spins cannot be directly coupled to the oscillating fields, while spins can feel heating driven by the beam. Based on Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation with the beam-driven heating, we show that vortex beams in ultraviolet or visible range can generate multiple ring-shape magnetic defects such as skyrmionium in chiral magnets. \cite{3} On the other hand, when we apply THz vortex beams to magnets, the direct coupling between the spins and the electromagnetic fields becomes relevant and richer spin dynamics occur. We show from the LLG simulation that the magnetic resonance driven by THz vortex beam in usual ferromagnets leads to a nanostructure with a finite spin scalar chirality, \cite{4} and it indicates the possibility of vortex-beam driven Hall effect in metallic magnets. We also show that THz vortex beam can simultaneously generate multiple skyrmions in chiral ferromagnets, depending on the value of the angular momentum, \cite{4} if the beams are sufficiently focusing beyond its diffraction limit with near-field techniques.

This has motivated intense research into the coherent interactions between mechanical resonators and qubits formed from photons, trapped atoms, superconducting circuits, quantum dots, and nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, to name a few.  I will describe our experiments to coherently control NV center spins through their coupling to the dynamic crystal lattice strain of a gigahertz-frequency mechanical resonator.

This field started around 2014 when it was found that ferromagnets in cavities hybridize with both microwaves and light via light-matter interaction. Since then, the emergence of this field has attracted broad interests. At the center stage of the topic is the physics of a quasi-particle called cavity magnon polariton (CMP). Via the quantum physics of spin-photon entanglement on the one hand, and via classical electrodynamic coupling on the other, CMP connects some of the most exciting modern physics, such as quantum information and quantum optics, with one of the oldest science on the earth, the magnetism. 

In this new community, most groups utilize the hybrid and nonlocal nature of CMP to develop cavity-mediated coupling techniques for both spintronic and quantum applications.

The effect, known as Einstein-de Haas or Richardson effect, demonstrates that a spin angular momentum in the magnet compensates for the mechanical angular momentum associated with its rotation.\cite{1} The experiment is therefore a macroscopic manifestation of the conservation of total angular momentum and energy of electronic spins. According to Noether's theorem, conservation of angular momentum follows from a system`s rotational invariance and would be valid for the ensemble of spins in a macroscopic ferromagnet as well as for an individual spin. It has been recently proposed that single spin systems would therefore manifest an Einstein-de Haas effect at the quantum level.\cite{2}\cite{3} 

We propose the first experimental realization of a quantum Einstein-de Haas experiment and describe a macroscopic manifestation of the conservation of total angular momentum in individual spins, using a TbPc$_2$ single molecule magnet coupled to a nanomechanical resonator.\cite{4} We demonstrate that the spin associated with the single molecule magnet is then subject to conservation of total angular momentum and energy which results in a total suppression of the molecule’s quantum tunneling of magnetization.\cite{5}","[1] https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevSeriesI.26.248

Here, we present ongoing work with recently-pioneered \cite{1} ‘ultracoherent’ membranes, which exploit phononic engineering and soft-clamping techniques to achieve unprecedented mechanical coherence.  With Q-factors of $10^8$ at room temperature and nearly $10^9$ at T$\sim$10K, these devices enable novel experiments in various regimes.

First, by moderate cryogenic cooling, we can readily achieve quantum cooperativities $C_Q = 4g^2/\kappa\gamma \gg 1$, enabling quantum protocols with a mechanical system whose thermal decoherence rate ($\gamma$) approaches that of trapped ions ($\sim$1 ms).  This should allow, for instance, stroboscopic QND localization of a single mechanical mode, or using a novel multimode device, two-mode mechanical squeezing and entanglement.  Remarkably, these membranes can even achieve $C_Q>1$ without cryogenic cooling, and by integration with low-noise fiber mirrors, achieve a macroscopic room-temperature system capable of quantum behavior.

We also exploit the high Q of these resonators to advance the capabilities of various hybrid systems.  These include electro-optomechanical systems\cite{2} as well as systems in which the membrane motion couples to the collective spin of a room-temperature atomic ensemble\cite{3}.  Finally, our soft-clamping techniques can also be exploited to advance force sensing applications.  Towards this end, we have developed low-mass soft-clamped resonators, which seek to advance scanning force microscopy (in particular, MRFM) by moving beyond the usual tip-as-sensor paradigm, and exploiting our ultracoherent mechanical devices.","[1]https://doi.org/10.1038/nnano.2017.101

Application of a weak magnetic field to a 2D film with random local anisotropy results in a skyrmion glass, Fig. 1. Quenched randomness stabilizes skyrmions that would otherwise collapse due the violation of the scale invariance by the atomic lattice \cite{3}. Good understanding of the properties of the skyrmion glass, such as field dependence of the concentration of skyrmions, their average size and stability, has been achieved via scaling arguments and confirmed by large-scale numerical studies of spin lattices \cite{4}. When quenched disorder is weak, evolution of labyrinth domains into compact topological structures on application of the magnetic field is governed by random configuration of Bloch lines inside domain walls \cite{5]. Depending on the combination of Bloch lines, the magnetic domains evolve into individual skyrmions, biskyrmions, or more complex topological objects. While the geometry of such objects is sensitive to the parameters, their topological charge is uniquely determined by the topological charge of Bloch lines inside the magnetic domain from which the object emerges.","[1] DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.112.097201

Owing to the damping of both photons and magnons, the polaritons have limited lifetimes. However, stationary magnon-polariton states can be reached by a dynamical balance between pumping and losses, so the intrinsically nonequilibrium system may be described by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We designed a tunable cavity magnon-polaritons system which has non-Hermitian spectral degeneracies. By tuning the magnon-photon coupling strength, we observed an exceptional point and spontaneous symmetry-breaking in the cavity magnon-polariton system, where coherent perfect absorption is achieved in the unbroken-symmetry regime but not in the broken-symmetry regime.

Magnetic resonance force microscopy (MRFM) is a version of nanoscale MRI capable of non-invasive three-dimensional atomic imaging of single samples \cite{1,2}.  MRFM signal strength scales quadratically with magnetic field gradient, and imaging time scales to its 4th power \cite{1}.  Access to highly magnetic tips are thus crucial for the advancement of MRFM toward and beyond single-proton sensitivity.

Current state of the art magnetic tips are made of amorphous or polycrystalline dysprosium and iron-cobalt alloys \cite{3,4}. While iron-based alloys are reaching their limit imposed by an intrinsically lower magnetic moment of 2.2 $\mu B$ \cite{4,5}, technology, namely the quality of nanoscale material quality that is achievable by e-beam evaporation onto room-temperature substrates, has limited rare-earth metals.    This is unfortunate as the rare-earth holmium (Ho) has the highest magnetic moment of any naturally occurring element, $10.6 \mu B$, and a bulk volume magnetization nearly twice as high as that of iron nanowires \cite{6}.  To push the nanotechnology for ultra-high-moment nanomagnets toward nature’s limit, we develop synthetic routes toward metallic holmium and dysprosium nanowires.  We select vacuum vapor deposition at elevated temperatures as a promising route towards these target nanostructures\cite{7,8,9}.  Work toward synthesizing ferromagnetic holmium nanowires via substrate-directed processes will be presented.","[1] https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0812068106

Among them, Yttrium Iron garnet (YIG), a magnetic insulator with very low damping, appears to be an excellent spin conductor [1] since it can propagate very efficiently magnons (the spin carrier). It has been established [2] that a pure spin current can be induced and detected between two Pt electrodes deposited few microns apart on top of YIG. Here we present a study of spin waves propagation in ultra-thin film of YIG (18nm) excited by large spin orbit torque. By injecting a high current density in Pt injector strip we are able to put our system strongly out of equilibrium. The main contribution of this work is an experimental evidence of a gradual spectral shift from thermal to subthermal magnon transport when a current density of Jc= 5.10^11 𝐴/𝑚² is injected in the Pt [4]. This value corresponds to the expected threshold current for damping compensation of the Kittel mode. Our results suggest that a new spin conduction channel appear in the GHz frequency range when damping compensation is reached. This observation is supported by microfocus Brillouin light scattering measurement. We show that at such high current density, an exponential decrease of the electrical resistivity of the YIG must be taken into account and give rise to a parasitic non-magnetic offset voltage in the detector strip which is not related to magnon propagation [3].","[1] Y.

They show a different orientation of the spin rotation, but also differ from their Bloch-type counterparts in that their orientation is determined by uniaxial anisotropy instead of an externally applied magnetic field. This anisotropy is apparent in a strong dependence of the magnetic phases on field orientation.
In order to quantify and understand the role of anisotropy in materials hosting Néel-type skyrmions, we perform dynamic cantilever magnetometry (DCM) \cite{2} on single crystal samples of GaV\textsubscript{4}S\textsubscript{8} and GaV\textsubscript{4}Se\textsubscript{8}.

Access to highly magnetic tips with precise, nanometer-resolution controls of tip geometry and material composition would further advance the technique by enabling closer approach of the gradient source to the sample \cite{5} \cite{6}.
 
One approach to controllable tip geometries is the bottom-up growth of single-crystalline magnetic nanowires \cite{7}.  However, the production of nanowire materials, uniformly oriented along any arbitrarily chosen crystal orientation, is an important, yet unsolved, problem in material science \cite{8}. A practical need for MRFM has thus led us to devise a generalizable solution to this material science problem, using FeCo as the demonstration material system. 

We found a solution is based on the technique of glancing angle deposition \cite{9} combined with a rapid switching of the deposition direction between crystal symmetry positions.  We showcase the power and simplicity of the process in one-step fabrications of <1 0 0>, <1 1 0>, <1 1 1>, <2 1 0>, <3 1 0>, <3 2 0> and <3 2 1>-oriented nanowires, three-dimensional nanowire spirals, core-shell heterostructures and axial hybrids.  The resulting nanowires are single-crystals, have high saturation magnetization of 2.0(2) Tesla, and passivated by a surface oxide below 3 nm in thickness after one year of storage in air.  Our results provide a new capability for tailoring the shape and properties of nanowires, should be generalizable to any material that can be grown as a single-crystal biaxial film, and has already offered a new route towards next-generation tip-on-cantilever MRFM sensors.","[1] https: //doi:10.1038/nnano.2007.105

Among these, inductive detection by miniaturized coils \cite{1} and nanoscale magnetometry using nitrogen-vacancy defects in diamond \cite{2} facilitate detection under ambient conditions.
Here, giant magneto-resistive (GMR) sensors are assessed for NMR detection at ambient conditions. The aim for GMR detection is the picotesla field sensitivity at radio frequency combined with the small sensor size in the micrometer regime \cite{3,4}. As shown recently in our lab, a GMR sensor immersed into water or ethanol can detect the $^1$H NMR spectrum of picoliter volumes at 0.3 T / 13 MHz \cite{5}. In this way, the GMR sensor detects the magnetic fields due to coherent precession of close-by nuclear spins.
In this contribution, we report on experiments at 0.7 T / 30 MHz and outline key aspects of GMR-detected NMR. Particular emphasis is laid on the influence of the 0.7 T field on the GMR sensor, which enforces an experimental alignment procedure. Using a sensor of 12x100 $\mu$m$^2$, the spectrum of water doped by a relaxation agent is obtained with an SNR of 10 and a linewidth of 1.4 ppm after 30 minutes. These figures are the basis for our ongoing optimization of the NMR performance. First, we consider potential susceptibility effects, which could arise due to the ferromagnetic layers inside the GMR sensors. Second, we indicate how further sensitivity enhancement could be achieved with sensors based on magnetic tunnel junctions.","[1] https://doi.org/10.1126/science.270.5244.1967

Non-colinear antiferromagnetic systems do not suffer from this problem and often possess remarkable extra functionalities: non-collinear spin order\cite{1}  may break space-inversion symmetry\cite{2,3} and thus allow electric field control of magnetism\cite{4,5}, or produce emergent spin-orbit effects\cite{6,7} which enable spin-charge interconversion\cite{8}. To harness these unique traits for next-generation spintronics, the equivalent nanoscale control and imaging capabilities that are now routine for ferromagnets must be developed for antiferromagnetic systems. In this work, using a non-invasive scanning probe based on a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defect in diamond\cite{9,10}, we demonstrate the first real-space visualization of non-collinear antiferromagnetic order in a magnetic thin film, at room temperature. We image the spin cycloid of a multiferroic BiFeO3 thin film and extract a period of ≈70nm, consistent with values determined by macroscopic diffraction, in addition we take advantage of the magnetoelectric coupling present in BiFeO_3 to manipulate the cycloid propagation direction by an electric field. These results demonstrate how BiFeO_3 can be used as a versatile platform for the design of reconfigurable nanoscale spin textures. This also proves that this technique can be further used in investigating exotic materials and magnetic orders.","[1]https://doi.org/10.1139/p87-197

In my talk, I will give an introduction to the following topics: (1) Spin-Liquid spin current carried by spinons [2], (2) Phonon anomaly in spin Seebeck effects [3], and (3) Spin current coupled with mechanical motion [4], to discuss the general mechanism of spin-current interaction.

By virtue of slight asymmetries in geometry, a nanowire’s flexural modes can be split into doublets which oscillate along two orthogonal axes. By monitoring the frequency shift and direction of oscillation of both modes as we scan the nanowire above a sample surface, we construct a map of all in-plane tip-sample force gradients\cite{1}. We expand on this work and show that the two orthogonal modes exhibit coherent dynamics, through the demonstration of avoided crossings between the modes as well as Rabi oscillations. We deterministically tune both the coupling strength and the frequency of the modes by positioning the nanowire at suitable points in the electrostatic vector force field generated by the sample. The demonstrated coherent dynamics can be used to implement control protocols and spectroscopic measurements similar to those used in experimental quantum compuation and sensing.","[1] https://doi.org/10.1038/nnano.2016.189",,Braakman,"Floris R.",floris.braakman@unibas.ch,"University of Basel","Klingelbergstrasse 82, 4056, Basel",Switzerland,None,"N.

Recently coupling of mechanical to electromagnetic modes has gained importance because of possible use in so called transmons and their application for quantum computing \cite{1},\cite{2} . Yttrium Iron Garnet would be extremely interesting as a nanoresonator material because it combines long lifetimes as well for spin waves (magnons) as for mechanical waves (phonons) and a coupling mechanism for both (magnetoelastic coupling or magnetostriction). Coupling of magnons to phonons in YIG spheres of diameters of a few hundred micron has already been demonstrated\cite{3} but making true 3D YIG nanoresonators would open up a new field of applications for nanooscillators. However, up to now no method was available to shape three dimensional nanostructures from monocrystalline YIG. We have developed a process to build monocrystalline freestanding 3D YIG nanoresonators. The structures can be designed as suspended bridges, cantilevers but also as more complex structures like for example suspended rings or disks. The structures were investigated using transmission electron microscopy indicating high crystalline quality. In ferromagnetic resonance different modes can be observed. The linewidth for an ensemble of 8000 bridges was as small as 
7 Oe@6.5 GHz. Further investigation was done using time and spatially resolved Kerr microscopy. Here we see various standing spin waves including Damon Eshbach Modes and Backward Volume Modes. Based on these measurements also the damping for a single resonator could be determined to $\alpha < 4\times 10^{-4}$. The modes observed can be nicely reproduced in 3D micromagnetic simulations.","[1]https://doi.org/doi:10.1038/nature08967

Using this system, we have been able to measure calibrated mechanical torques as small as 32 zNm, corresponding to sensing an external field of 0.12 A/m (150 nT).

Besides being extremely sensitive force sensors, their highly symmetric cross-section results in flexural modes doublets that are nearly degenerate and allow to detect forces along two orthogonal directions. Such NWs enable a form of force microscopy capable of mapping both size and direction of tip-sample forces \cite{1,2}.
	In order to extend these capabilities to magnetic force microscopy, here we investigate GaAs NWs – 200 nm in diameter – grown by molecular beam epitaxy to have a MnAs ferromagnetic crystal at their tip \cite{3}. By monitoring the mechanical resonance frequencies of the NW’s mode doublet as a function of the applied field \cite{4}, it is possible to reveal the saturation magnetization, anisotropy energy, and reversal of the magnetic tip. Moreover, additional details on the magnetic anisotropy axis can be accessed thanks to the vectorial nature of the NW sensor. By comparison with numerical simulations, we identify signatures in the magnetic torque related to magnetization switching and even to the nucleation of a magnetic vortex. Using a well-known magnetic field profile, generated by a current carrying wire, we also determine the tip-equivalent magnetic surface charge density to calibrate the sensor’s response to inhomogeneous magnetic field.
	In principle, such NW sensors, due to their nanometric magnetic tip and their high force sensitivity, are capable of mapping stray magnetic fields with enhanced sensitivity and resolution compared to the state of the art.","[1]https://doi.org/10.1038/nnano.2016.189

The realization of magnetometric tips is challenging and will be the topic of this presentation.
Homoepitaxial growth of ultra pure diamond on single crystalline diamond substrates has been extensively developed at IAF\cite{1}. The microwave plasma assisted CVD process is carried out in an UHV load-lock system where methane is purified by means of a zirconium gas-purification system in combination with palladium hydrogen purification. After homoepitaxy the substrates are lasercut and scaife-polished to yield 30-50µm membranes. Diamond vertical waveguide tips are fabricated via a top-down process by use of highly anisotropic plasma dry etching2. These tips typically exhibit diameters of 200 nm with lengths ranging from 2 to 4 µm\cite{2}. Shallow NV centers at the apex were realized by Nitrogen implantation or by growth of Nitrogen delta-doped diamond layers in combination with thermal annealing. Nitrogen concentration can be controlled from the lower ppb level to 500ppm for delta layers of typically 20nm thickness, yielding high T2 times above 100µs. Several hundred micro-optical tips are realized per membrane. Tips are singulated and transferred to quartz tuning fork AFM probes by use of micro manipulators (Imina Technolgies SA).

A non-equilibrium magnon population provided by a spin-polarized current in nanocontacts enables their creation and there is now clear experimental evidence for their formation including direct images obtained with scanning x-ray transmission microscopy. Interest in magnetic droplets is associated with their unique magnetic dynamics
that can lead to new types of high frequency nanometer scale oscillators of interest for information processing, including in neuromorphic computing. However, there are no direct measurements of the time required to nucleate droplet solitons or their lifetime—experiments to date only probe their steady-state characteristics, their response to dc spin-currents. Here we show in experiments with short current pulses that there are very different timescales for
droplet annihilation and generation: annihilation occurs in a few nanoseconds while generation can take up to a microsecond. Micromagnetic simulations illustrate the magnetization dynamics associated with these processes and show that there can be an incubation delay for droplet generation.",,,Hahn,Christian,christian.hahn@ptb.de,"Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt","Bundesallee 100, 38116 Braunschweig",Germany,None,"Jinting Hang","Department of Physics, New York University, New York, New York 10003 USA","Andrew D.

With its sensitivity to electric and magnetic fields over a wide range of frequencies, we have used the NV center as a noise spectrometer to spectroscopically probe sources of surface-related decoherence, differentiating between electric and magnetic origins.

In a classical ESR spectrometer, the spins precess in an external magnetic field and emit small microwave signals into a cavity, which are amplified and measured. In this work \cite{1}, we make use of the toolbox of circuit quantum electrodynamics to boost the sensitivity of such a spectrometer by many orders of magnitude to the level of 65 spins/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ with a signal-to-noise ratio of 1.
This is achieved by using a low impedance, high quality factor superconducting micro-resonator in conjunction with a Josephson parametric amplifier operated below 20 mk \cite{2}. The energy relaxation time T$_1$ of the spins (Bi donors in $^{28}$Si) is limited by the Purcell effect to 20 ms allowing fast repetitive measurements while the coherence time T$_2$ is approximately 1.7 ms. 
The necessarily narrow bandwidth of our resonator distorts the shape of our short drive pulses and in order to control the spin ensemble more accurately, we employ shaped compensation pulses canceling the filtering effect of the cavity. Then, we perform electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) experiments at low magnetic fields allowing us to detect weakly coupled $^{29}$Si nuclear spin impurities in our $^{28}$Si sample.

While spintronics, based on charge transport by spin polarized electrons, made its leap in data storage by providing extremely sensitive detectors in magnetic hard-drives, it turned out to be challenging to transport spin information without great losses. With magnonics a visionary concept inspired researchers worldwide: Utilize magnons - the collective excitation quanta of the spin system in magnetically ordered materials - as carriers for spin information.

While macroscopic prototypes of magnonic logic gates already have been demonstrated, the full potential of magnonics lies in the combination of magnons with nano-sized spin textures. Both magnons and spin textures share a common ground set by the interplay of dipolar, spin-orbit and exchange energies rendering them perfect interaction partners. Magnons are fast, sensitive to the spins’ directions and easily driven far from equilibrium. Spin textures are robust, non-volatile and still reprogrammable on ultrashort timescales.

In this presentation I will discuss magnon propagation in spin textures and how these magnons can be locally excited in spin textures by pure spin currents.","[1] https://doi.org/10.1038/nnano.2015.339

Pure spin currents can propagate not only in metals and semiconductors, but also in magnetically ordered insulators. This makes a whole new set of materials and material combinations interesting for spin transport experiments and spin-electronic devices. 
A prototypical example for this development is the spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) effect, which arises in magnetic insulator/normal metal hybrid structures owing to the flow of spin angular momentum across the magnet/metal interface. In the last few years, the SMR response of ferrimagnetic insulators with both collinear as well as non-collinear magnetic structure has been extensively investigated.

We have integrated magnet-tipped cantilevers into a scanned-probe microscope having three-dimensional coarse and fine positioning, operating at 4.2 kelvin, and having a 0 to 9 tesla magnetic field.  We have carried out magnetic resonance experiments on a 200 nm thick film of polystyrene doped with a nitroxide free radical.   This sample was spun-cast 
onto a coplanar waveguide (10 micrometer centerline, operating from dc to 40 Ghz).   We could significantly reduce surface-related cantilever frequency noise by coating the sample with a 10 nm metal layer and applying a voltage to the cantilever.  To align the cantilever with the coplanar waveguide’s centerline we employ ``edge-finder’’ cantilever frequency shifts fortuitously present when a voltage bias is applied to the waveguide’s centerline \cite{3}.  We used force-gradient detection (e.g., frequency shifts) to sensitively detect Curie-law proton magnetization at 6 T, electron-spin resonance at 0.6 T, and hyperpolarized proton magnetization created by cross-effect dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) at 0.6 T \cite{4,5}.   To assess the potential improvements in MRFM imaging obtainable with DNP, we have developed a theory of the signal-to-noise ratio covering MRFM experiments detecting magnetization fluctuations (having a random sign) and Curie-law and hyperpolarized magnetization (with a well-defined sign).   We have developed rapid Bayesian protocols for reconstructing proton-density images of isolated proteins from force-fluctuation maps and for determining the location of individual electron spins from frequency-shift maps \cite{6}.","[1] https:// doi.org/10.1116/1.3581102

"2017/11/06 10:56:46 AM UTC+1","Toward magnetic resonance force microscopy with a membrane resonator","Waiting List","Most scanning force microscopes rely on a cantilever beam as the sensing element. By contrast, we are investigating a novel approach to force microscopy that employs a silicon nitride membrane as both the sample platform and the force transducer. Our membranes \cite{1} are engineered to support extremely high quality factors (10^8 at room temperature), which allows for small thermal force noise even for stiff membranes.
As a first step, we aim to demonstrate membrane-based force microscopy as well as parametric sensing protocols\cite{2,3}, two key steps required for later MRFM detection. Our approach is expected to open up new possibilities in force sensing and NanoMRI.","[1] https://doi.org/10.1038/nnano.2017.101

"2017/11/10 10:07:42 AM UTC+1","3D Quantitative MFM","Waiting List","Quantitative measurements of nanomagnetic structures are inherently difficult due to the vectorial nature of magnetic fields and because of often-complex interactions between sample and sensor. We report on a magnetic force microscopy (MFM) technique that allows us to perform quantitative measurements of the magnetic stray fields from nanoscale objects. By scanning magnet-tipped, attonewton-sensitivity cantilever over a sample and measuring at the same time both the static deflection (dc component) and frequency change (ac component) of the cantilever, two independent datasets of the magnetic field can be obtained in a single MFM scan. We apply the technique for reconstructing the full three-dimensional magnetic stray field of a conical Dy nanopillar as it is used in magnetic resonance force microscopy experiments.",,,Grob,Urs,grobu@ethz.ch,"ETH Zurich","Otto-Stern-Weg 1, CH-8093 Zürich",Switzerland,None,"M.

"2017/11/09 9:09:01 PM UTC+1","SOI-less fabrication of silicon nanomechanical resonators","Waiting List","Force sensors made from silicon are central to scanning probe force microscopy in general and magnetic resonance force microscopy (MRFM) in particular.  Historic advances pushing the sensitivity limit of silicon-based mechanical devices have included nanostructuring \cite{1, 2}, surface chemical passivation \cite{2, 3, 4}, and cooling \cite{5, 6}.   Recently, state of the art, batch produced, nanoladder cantilevers have achieved record force sensitivities at ~100 zN/rtHz \cite{7}, motivating on-going experiments aiming to measure and image single nuclear spins by force detection.

As MRFM sensor technology matures, we continue to push for cost-effectiveness, manufacturability, and better performance in nanoscale silicon force sensors.  We are developing a method to batch fabricate silicon nanowire and nanoladder mechanical resonators from bulk silicon wafers.  We present progress toward traditionally SOI-derived, suspended nanomechanical structures using plain bulk silicon wafers as the starting material.  We discuss additional versatility of our approach beyond what can be achieved using the SOI technology.","[1] https://doi.org/10.1109/SENSOR.2003.1216966

Recently, we showed that mechanical resonators made of suspended carbon nanotubes display outstanding properties, such as quality factors up to 5 million, and force noise as low as 10-21 N Hz-1/2 [2]. We propose to use this excellent sensitivity capability to detect and manipulate the nuclear spins of the 13C atoms naturally present in the carbon nanotube.
