# Tools suite to manage automatically a conference booklet with python and LaTeX

This repository contains a tool suite in python / latex to manage a scientific conference automatically. It has been used to generate the booklet of the "spin mechanics & nano-MRI workshop" held at the Ã‰cole de Physique des Houches in Feb, 2018.

The concept is as simple as  1) on one hand, asking the participants to fill up themselves a  database (file 'database.csv', a coma separated value file managed by google webform) containing all the informations concerning the speaker (name, affilitation etc..) and his talk (tile, collaborators, abstract, figures etc.. even the bibliography is managed automatically through the exploitation of DOI), while 2) on the other hand, the organizer fills up the program through a timetable file (file 'program.txt').

The booklet compiles automatically, creates the daily summaries, timetables, builds the abstracts with time stamps for the expected talk, ranks them chronologically, creates different index tables. The solution offers great flexibility in the management of the event.

Objective of the next release: to provide an automatic feedback about the compilation of the abstract.
