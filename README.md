# Automatically manage a conference booklet using pyhton and LaTeX

This repository contains the python / latex tools suite to manage a scientific conference automatically. It has been used to generate the booklet of the spin mechanics & nano-MRI workshop held at the École de Physique des Houches in Feb, 2018. 

The concept is as simple as letting in one hand, the participants fill up themselves a database (file 'database.csv' generated by a google webform) containing all the informations concerning the participants (name, affilitation etc..) and their talk (the bibligraphy is also managed automatically through the use of DOI), while on the other hand, the organizers control the whole schedule through a timetable file (file 'program.txt')

The booklet compiles automatically according to the timetable.
